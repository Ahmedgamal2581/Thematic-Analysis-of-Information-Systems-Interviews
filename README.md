# Thematic Analysis of Information Systems Interviews

## Project Description
This project involves a qualitative analysis of interviews conducted in the field of Information Systems using NVivo software. The goal is to extract recurring ideas and key themes to understand participants' perspectives and provide recommendations that support decision-making and research development.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **NVivo**: For qualitative data analysis and thematic coding.
- **Microsoft Word**: Used for organizing and editing the interview files.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For demographic data extraction and dashboard creation.

## Project Overview
This project was carried out on a freelance platform (mostaqel), focusing on analyzing 10 interviews related to Information Systems. The interviews were initially compiled into a single Word document and then separated into individual files for analysis. The demographic data was extracted into an Excel file, and a dashboard was created to visualize the data. 

The thematic analysis was performed using NVivo, where recurring themes were identified and coded. The final report contains detailed insights from the analysis, which were then linked to previous studies in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the findings.

## Steps Involved
1. **Interview Files**: The 10 interviews were compiled into a single Word document, and each interview was separated into its own individual file for analysis.
2. **Demographic Data**: Demographic data was extracted from the interviews and compiled into an Excel file. A dashboard was created to visualize these demographics.
3. **Thematic Analysis**: Thematic analysis was performed using NVivo, identifying recurring themes and patterns from the interviews.
4. **Report Creation**: A detailed report was prepared summarizing the analysis and insights from NVivo. This report was then linked to previous studies to strengthen the findings.

## Deliverables
- A Word document containing the full report of the thematic analysis.
- An Excel file with extracted demographic data and a dashboard.
- NVivo project file containing the coded data and themes.
- A final report that links the analysis to existing literature and research studies.

## How to Use
1. **Demographic Data and Dashboard**: Open the provided Excel file to explore the demographic data and dashboard.
2. **NVivo Analysis**: Open the NVivo project file to view the thematic coding and analysis performed.
3. **Report**: Refer to the Word document for a detailed summary of the analysis and insights.

## Target Audience
This project is beneficial for researchers, data analysts, and decision-makers in the field of Information Systems who seek qualitative insights to support their strategies and research development.
